Implemented a house prediction algorithm using python and without using standard machine lerarning libraries.
Implemented the code for Multilinear regression.
Applied three models M1 M2 and M3 with variations in the number of parameters.
Performed Matrix multiplication to find the weights of the linear regression model using Numpy multiplication.
Normal Equation: Weights=(X(transpse).X)^-1X.Y
Calculated the Adjusted R-square value for each model to select the best model.
